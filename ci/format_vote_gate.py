"""Format-specification vote gate (see `.github/workflows/format-vote-gate.yml`).

Structurally enforces the PMC vote required for Lance format-specification
changes (https://lance.org/community/voting/). The `format-change` label is
applied by the path labeler (`.github/labeler-area.yml`); this script reads it
and publishes the `format-spec-vote` commit status, which blocks merging until:

  * 3 PMC members have approved the PR (excluding the author), counted only on
    the head commit so new pushes invalidate stale approvals;
  * no PMC member has an outstanding "Request changes" review (a veto); and
  * the 72-hour voting period has elapsed. The clock starts once the PR is both
    labeled and out of draft, and pauses over weekends.

A PMC member can waive a trivial edit by applying the `format-waived` label.
Non-format PRs get a passing status immediately and are otherwise left alone.
Drafts get a blocking status but no comment: the vote has not opened yet.

The vote-counting and deadline rules are pure functions (`tally_reviews`,
`decide_verdict`, `vote_opened_at`, `weekday_deadline`) unit tested in
`test_format_vote_gate.py`; `main` wires them to the GitHub API.
