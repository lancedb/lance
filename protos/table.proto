  // created with one file of N columns, the field ids will be 1, 2, ..., N. If a
  // second, fragment is created with M columns, the field ids will be N+1, N+2,
  // ..., N+M.
  //
  // In Lance v1 there is one field for each field in the input schema, this includes
  // nested fields (both struct and list).  Fixed size list fields have only a single
  // field id (these are not considered nested fields in Lance v1).
  //
  // This allows column indices to be calculated from field IDs and the input schema.
  //
  // In Lance v2 the field IDs generally follow the same pattern but there is no
  // way to calculate the column index from the field ID.  This is because a given
  // field could be encoded in many different ways, some of which occupy a different
  // number of columns.  For example, a struct field could be encoded into N + 1 columns
  // or it could be encoded into a single packed column.  To determine column indices
  // the column_indices property should be used instead.

  // Otherwise there must be one entry for each field in `fields`.
  //
  // Some fields may not correspond to a top-level column in the file.  In these cases
  // the index will -1.
  //
  // For example, consider the schema:
  //
  // - dimension: packed-struct (0):
  //   - x: u32 (1)
  //   - y: u32 (2)
  // - path: string (3)

  //   - simple-struct (6)
  //     - margin: fp64 (7)
  //     - padding: fp64 (8)
  //
  // One possible column indices array could be:
  // [0, -1, -1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
  //
  // This reflects quite a few phenomenon:
  // - The packed struct is encoded into a single column and there is no top-level column
  //   for the x or y fields
  // - The string is encoded into two columns
  // - The embedding is encoded into a single column (common for FSL of primitive) and there
  //   is not "FSL column"
