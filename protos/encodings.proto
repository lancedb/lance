// This file contains a specification for encodings that can be used
// to store and load Arrow data into a Lance file.
//
// # Types
//
// This file assumes the user wants to load data into Arrow arrays and
// explains how to map Arrow arrays into Lance files.  Encodings are divided
// into "array encoding" (which maps to an Arrow array and may contain multiple
// buffers) and "buffer encoding" (which encodes a single buffer of data).
//
// # Encoding Tree
//
// Most encodings are layered on top of each other.  These form a tree of
// encodings with a single root node.  To encode an array you will typically
// start with the root node and then take the output from that root encoding
// and feed it into child encodings.  The decoding process works in reverse.
//
// # Multi-column Encodings
//
// Some Arrow arrays will map to more than one column of Lance data.  For
// example, struct arrays and list arrays.  This file only contains encodings
// for a single column.  However, it does describe how multi-column arrays can
// be encoded.

// A pointer to a buffer in a Lance file
//
// A writer can place a buffer in three different locations.  The buffer
// can go in the data page, in the column metadata, or in the file metadata.
// The writer is free to choose whatever is most appropriate (for example, a dictionary
// that is shared across all pages in a column will probably go in the column
// metadata).  This specification does not dictate where the buffer should go.
message Buffer {
    // The index of the buffer in the collection of buffers
    uint32 buffer_index = 1;
    // The collection holding the buffer
    enum BufferType {
      // The buffer is stored in the data page itself
      page = 0;
      // The buffer is stored in the column metadata
      column = 1;
      // The buffer is stored in the file metadata
      file = 2;
    };
    BufferType buffer_type = 2;

// bitmaps and boolean arrays)

// is stored in a separate bitmap

// the fields you would expect (integers, floats, temporal types) as
// well as null, boolean, and fixed size list/string/binary types.

    // type of uint64, and will never have nulls.
