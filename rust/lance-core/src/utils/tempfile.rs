//! Utility functions for creating temporary files and directories.
//!
//! Most of these types wrap around the `tempfile` crate.  We add two
//! additional features:
//!
//! * There are wrappers around temporary directories and files that expose
//!   the dir/file as an object store path, std path, or string, which can save
//!   some boilerplate.
//! * We work around a current bug in the `url` crate which fails to parse
//!   Windows paths like `C:\` correctly.  We do so by replacing all `\` with
//!   `/` in the path.  This is not safe in general (e.g. paths may use `\` as
//!   an escape) but it should be safe for temporary paths.
