//! A task to clean up a lance dataset, removing files that are no longer
//! needed.
//!
//! Currently we try and be rather conservative about what we delete.
//!
//! The following types of files may be deleted by the cleanup function:
//!
//! * Old manifest files - If a manifest file is older than the threshold
//!   and is not the latest manifest then it will be deleted.
//! * Unreferenced data files - If a data file is not referenced by any
//!   fragment in a valid manifest file then it will be deleted.
//! * Unreferenced delete files - If a delete file is not referenced by
//!   any fragment in a valid manifest file then it will be deleted.
//! * Unreferenced index files - If an index file is not referenced by
//!   any valid manifest file then it will be deleted.
//!
//! It is also difficult to distinguish between a data/tx/idx file which was
//! leftover from an abandoned transaction and a data file which is part
//! of an ongoing operation (both will look like unreferenced data files).
//!
//! If the file is referenced by at least one manifest (even if that manifest
//! is old and being deleted) then we assume it is not part of an ongoing
//! operation and can be safely deleted.
//!
//! If the data is not referenced by any manifest then we look at the age of
//! the file.  If the file is at least 7 days old then we assume it is probably
//! not part of any ongoing operation and we will delete it.
//!
//! Otherwise we will leave the file unless delete_unverified is set to true.
//! (which should only be done if the caller can guarantee there are no updates
//! happening at the same time)

/// that lists storage itself and needs an authoritative "keep set").

/// and may change. It is only defined for datasets without branches, detached
/// versions, external (multi-base) fragments, external row-id files, or external
/// row-version metadata; [`Dataset::referenced_files`] errors otherwise.
///
/// # How to use it safely
///
/// Do **not** hand-roll an anti-join like `listed_files - exact_paths`: that
/// deletes blob sidecars, index files, tags, and staging manifests, none of
/// which are enumerated verbatim. Instead, for each file you listed under a
/// *managed subtree* (`data/`, `_deletions/`, `_transactions/`, `_indices/`,
/// and `_versions/*.manifest`), call [`is_referenced`](Self::is_referenced);
/// delete only files it returns `false` for, and only past a caller-enforced
/// age threshold (this is a point-in-time snapshot, so a file written just
/// before its commit lands is referenced by no present manifest yet).
///
/// Never treat these as orphan candidates — this set does not describe them:
/// `_refs/` (tags/branches), staging manifests (`_versions/.tmp*`), the
/// version-hint file, and `_mem_wal/` (MemWAL entries, SSTables, and PK-index
/// sidecars, which are live data enumerated nowhere in this set).
///
/// Directory-marker objects (zero-byte keys like `data/{key}/` or
/// `_indices/{uuid}/` that some tools create) are not referenced either — they
/// name a directory, not a file this set tracks.
///
/// [`is_referenced`](Self::is_referenced) already encapsulates the blob v2
/// sidecar rule (a sidecar `data/{key}/{blob_id}.blob` is referenced iff its
/// parent `data/{key}.lance` is) and the index-prefix rule, so callers cannot
/// get them wrong. The [`exact_paths`](Self::exact_paths) /
