//! Writing data overlay files.
//!
//! An overlay supplies new values for a subset of a fragment's
//! `(offset_in_frag, field)` cells without rewriting its base data files. This
//! module stages one: [`OverlayWriter`] takes batches of values keyed by
//! `_rowaddr`, writes them into a value file, and accumulates the coverage the
//! read path resolves them by. See the [module documentation](super) for the
//! coordinate spaces involved.
//!
//! Two invariants are the caller's to satisfy and this writer's to enforce,
//! because nothing downstream can:
//!
//! - **Values are addressed by rank.** An overlay stores a field's values
//!   densely, in ascending `offset_in_frag` order, and a covered cell's value is
//!   found by counting the covered cells below it. A stream that revisited an
//!   offset it had passed would put its values on the wrong rows, and every
//!   later value with them. Offsets must therefore strictly ascend, per field,
//!   across the writer's whole lifetime.
//! - **Coverage is not value-nullness.** A covered offset holding NULL overrides
//!   that cell *to* NULL; an offset absent from the coverage falls through to
//!   the base value. Passing a null to mean "leave this cell alone" silently
//!   erases live data.
//!
//! Neither the commit path nor the read path can catch a violation of either:
//! `build_manifest` checks that an overlay's target fragment exists and that a
//! fragment's overlays are ordered newest-last, and resolution trusts the
//! coverage it is handed. This writer is where they are checked.
