//! Conflict detection mechanisms for concurrent operations
//!
//! This module provides Bloom Filter-based conflict detection for merge insert operations.
//! It implements a two-tier storage strategy:
//! - For small datasets (<200KB): exact primary key mapping
//! - For large datasets (>=200KB): probabilistic Bloom Filter
//!
//! The conflict detection works by:
//! 1. Collecting primary keys during merge insert operations
//! 2. Building either exact mappings or Bloom Filters based on data size
//! 3. Storing the conflict detection data in transaction files
//! 4. Performing intersection-based conflict detection during commit
