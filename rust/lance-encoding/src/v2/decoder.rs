/// A scheduler for a field's worth of data
///
/// Each field in a reader's output schema maps to one field scheduler.  This scheduler may
/// map to more than one column.  For example, one field of struct data may
/// cover many columns of child data.  In fact, the entire file is treated as one
/// top-level struct field.
///
/// The scheduler is responsible for calculating the necessary I/O.  One schedule_range
/// request could trigger multiple batches of I/O across multiple columns.  The scheduler
/// should emit decoders into the sink as quickly as possible.
///
/// As soon as the scheduler encounters a batch of data that can decoded then the scheduler
/// should emit a decoder in the "unloaded" state.  The decode stream will pull the decoder
/// and start decoding.
///
/// The order in which decoders are emitted is important.  Pages should be emitted in
/// row-major order allowing decode of complete rows as quickly as possible.
///
/// The `FieldScheduler` should be stateless and `Send` and `Sync`.  This is
/// because it might need to be shared.  For example, a list page has a reference to
/// the field schedulers for its items column.  This is shared with the follow-up I/O
/// task created when the offsets are loaded.
