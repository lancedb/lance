//! Routines for encoding and decoding miniblock data
//!
//! Miniblock encoding is one of the two structural encodings in Lance 2.1.
//! In this approach the data is compressed into a series of chunks put into
//! a single buffer.
//!
//! A chunk must be encoded or decoded as a unit.  There is a small amount of
//! chunk metadata such as the number and size of each buffer in the chunk.
//!
//! Any form of compression can be used since we are compressing and decompressing
//! entire chunks.
