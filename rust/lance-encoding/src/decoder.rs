//! Utilities and traits for decoding data
//!
//! There are two types of decoders, logical decoders and physical decoders.
//! In addition, decoding data is broken into two steps, scheduling the I/O
//! and decoding the returned data.
//!
//! # Physical vs. Logical Decoding
//!
//! The physical traits are [`self::PhysicalPageScheduler`] and
//! [`self::PhysicalPageDecoder`].  These are lower level encodings.  They
//! have a few advantages:
//!
//!  * They do not need to decode into an Arrow array and so they don't need
//!    to be enveloped into the Arrow filesystem (e.g. Arrow doesn't have a
//!    bit-packed type.  We can use variable-length binary but that is kind
//!    of overkill)
//!  * They can decode into existing storage.  This can allow for "page
//!    bridging".  If we are trying to decode into a batch of 1024 rows and
//!    the rows 0..1024 are spread across two pages then we can avoid a memory
//!    copy by allocating once and decoding each page into the outer allocation.
//!
//! However, there are some limitations too:
//!
//!  * They are constrained to a single column
//!  * The API is more complex
//!
//! The logical traits are [`self::LogicalPageScheduler`] and [`self::LogicalPageDecoder`]
//! These are designed to map from Arrow fields into one or more columns of Lance
//! data.  They do not decode into existing buffers and instead they return an Arrow Array.
//!
//! Encodings are typically nested into each other to form a tree.  The top of the tree is
//! the user requested schema.  Each field in that schema is assigned to one top-level logical
//! encoding.  That encoding can then contain other logical encodings or physical encodings.
//! Physical encodings can also contain other physical encodings.
//!
//! So, for example, a single field in the Arrow schema might have the type List<UInt32>
//!
//! The encoding tree could then be:
//!
//! root: List (logical encoding)
//!  - indices: Primitive (logical encoding)
//!    - column: Basic (physical encoding)
//!      - validity: Bitmap (physical encoding)
//!      - values: RLE (physical encoding)
//!        - runs: Value (physical encoding)
//!        - values: Value (physical encoding)
//!  - items: Primitive (logical encoding)
//!    - column: Basic (physical encoding)
//!      - values: Value (phsyical encoding)
//!
//! Note that, in this example, root.items.column does not have a validity because there were
//! no nulls in the page.
//!
//! Note that the decoding API is not symmetric with the encoding API.  The encoding API contains
//! buffer encoders, array encoders, and field encoders.  Physical decoders correspond to both
//! buffer encoders and array encoders.  Logical decoders correspond to both array encoders and
//! field encoders.
//!
//! ## Multiple buffers or multiple columns?
//!
//! Note that there are many different ways we can write encodings.  For example, we might
//! store primitive fields in a single column with two buffers (one for validity and one for
//! values)
//!
//! On the other hand, we could also store a primitive field as two different columns.  One
//! that yields a non-nullable boolean array and one that yields a non-nullable array of items.
//! Then we could combine these two arrays into a single array where the boolean array is the
//! bitmap.  There are a few subtle differences between the approaches:
//!
//! * Storing things as multiple buffers within the same column is generally more efficient and
//!   easier to schedule.  For example, in-batch coalescing is very easy but can only be done
//!   on data that is in the same page.
//! * When things are stored in multiple columns you have to worry about their pages not being
//!   in sync.  In our previous validity / values example this means we might have to do some
//!   memory copies to get the validity array and values arrays to be the same length as
//!   decode.
//! * When things are stored in a single column, projection is impossible.  For example, if we
//!   tried to store all the struct fields in a single column with lots of buffers then we wouldn't
//!   be able to read back individual fields of the struct.
//! * When things are stored in a single column they must have the same length.  This is an issue
//!   for list fields.  The items column does not usually have the same length as the parent list
//!   column (in most cases it is much longer).
//!
//! The fixed size list decoding is an interesting example because it is actually both a physical
//! encoding and a logical encoding.  A fixed size list of a physical encoding is, itself, a physical
//! encoding (e.g. a fixed size list of doubles).  However, a fixed size list of a logical encoding
//! is a logical encoding (e.g. a fixed size list of structs).
//!
//! # The scheduling loop
//!
//! Reading a Lance file involves both scheduling and decoding.  Its generally expected that these
//! will run as two separate threads.

//!
//! The scheduling thread will work through the file from the
//! start to the end as quickly as possible.  Data is scheduled one page at a time in a row-major
//! fashion.  For example, imagine we have a file with the following page structure:
//!
//! ```text
//! Score (Float32)     | C0P0 |
//! Id (16-byte UUID)   | C1P0 | C1P1 | C1P2 | C1P3 |
//! Vector (4096 bytes) | C2P0 | C2P1 | C2P2 | C2P3 | .. | C2P1024 |
//! ```
//!
//! This would be quite common as each of these pages has the same number of bytes.  Let's pretend
//! each page is 1MiB and so there are 256Ki rows of data.  Each page of `Score` has 256Ki rows.
//! Each page of `Id` has 64Ki rows.  Each page of `Vector` has 256 rows.  The scheduler would then
//! schedule in the following order:
//!
//! C0 P0
//! C1 P0
//! C2 P0
//! C2 P1
//! ... (254 pages omitted)
//! C2 P255
//! C1 P1
//! C2 P256
//! ... (254 pages omitted)
//! C2 P511
//! C1 P2
//! C2 P512
//! ... (254 pages omitted)
//! C2 P767
//! C1 P3
//! C2 P768
//! ... (254 pages omitted)
//! C2 P1024
//!
//! This is the ideal scheduling order because it means we can decode complete rows as quickly as possible.
//! Note that the scheduler thread does not need to wait for I/O to happen at any point.  As soon as it starts
//! it will start scheduling one page of I/O after another until it has scheduled the entire file's worth of
//! I/O.  This is slightly different than other file readers which have "row group parallelism" and will
//! typically only schedule X row groups worth of reads at a time.
//!
//! In the near future there will be a backpressure mechanism and so it may need to stop/pause if the compute
//! falls behind.
//!
//! ## Indirect I/O
//!
//! Regrettably, there are times where we cannot know exactly what data we need until we have partially decoded
//! the file.  This happens when we have variable sized list data.  In that case the scheduling task for that
//! page will only schedule the first part of the read (loading the list offsets).  It will then immediately
//! spawn a new tokio task to wait for that I/O and decode the list offsets.  That follow-up task is not part
//! of the scheduling loop or the decode loop.  It is a free task.  Once the list offsets are decoded we submit
//! a follow-up I/O task.  This task is scheduled at a high priority because the decoder is going to need it soon.
//!
//! # The decode loop
//!
//! As soon as the scheduler starts we can start decoding.  Each time we schedule a page we
//! push a decoder for that page's data into a channel.  The decode loop
//! ([`BatchDecodeStream`]) reads from that channel.  Each time it receives a decoder it
//! waits until the decoder has all of its data.  Then it grabs the next decoder.  Once it has
//! enough loaded decoders to complete a batch worth of rows it will spawn a "decode batch task".
//!
//! These batch decode tasks perform the actual CPU work of decoding the loaded data into Arrow
//! arrays.  This may involve signifciant CPU processing like decompression or arithmetic in order
//! to restore the data to its correct in-memory representation.
//!
//! ## Batch size
//!
//! The `BatchDecodeStream` is configured with a batch size.  This does not need to have any
//! relation to the page size(s) used to write the data.  This keeps our compute work completely
//! independent of our I/O work.  We suggest using small batch sizes:
//!
//!  * Batches should fit in CPU cache (at least L3)
//!  * More batches means more opportunity for parallelism
//!  * The "batch overhead" is very small in Lance compared to other formats because it has no
//!    relation to the way the data is stored.

    // field nullability would be missing / incorrect and its also not as easy
    // as it sounds since pages can have different encodings and those encodings
    // often have various layers.  Also, sometimes the inference is just impossible.
    // For example, both Timestamp, Float64, Int64, and UInt64 will be encoded
    // as 8-byte value encoding.  The only way to know the data type is to look
    // at the schema.
    //
    // We also can't just guess the encoding based on the schema.  This is because
    // there may be multiple different ways to encode a field and it may even
    // change on a page-by-page basis.
    //
    // For example, if a field is a struct field then we expect a header
    // column that could have one of a few different encodings.
    //
    // This could be encoded with "simple struct" and an empty header column
    // followed by the shredded child columns.  It could be encoded as a nullable
    // struct where the nulls are in a dense bitmap.  It could even be encoded
    // as a packed (row-major) struct where there is only a single column containing
    // all of the data!
    //
    // TODO: Still lots of research to do here in different ways that
    // we can map schemas to buffers.
    //
    // Example: repetition levels - the validity bitmaps for nested
    // fields are fatter (more than one bit per row) and contain
    // validity information about parent fields (e.g. is this a
    // struct-struct-null or struct-null-null or null-null-null?)
    //
    // Examples: sentinel-shredding - instead of creating a wider
    // validity bitmap we assign more sentinels to each column.  So
    // if the values of an int32 array have a max of 1000 then we can
    // use 1001 to mean null int32 and 1002 to mean null parent.
    //
    // Examples: Sparse structs - the struct column has a validity
    // bitmap that must be read if you plan on reading the struct
    // or any nested field.  However, this could be a compressed
    // bitmap stored in metadata.  A perk for this approach is that
    // the child fields can then have a smaller size than the parent
    // field.  E.g. if a struct is 1000 rows and 900 of them are
    // null then there is one validity bitmap of length 1000 and
    // 100 rows of each of the children.
    //
    // TODO: In the future, this will need to be more flexible if
    // we want to allow custom encodings.  E.g. if the field's encoding
    // is not an encoding we expect then we should delegate to a plugin.
