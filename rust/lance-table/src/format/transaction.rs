//! Transaction struct for lance-table format layer.
//!
//! This struct is introduced to provide a Struct-first API for passing transaction
//! information within the lance-table crate. It mirrors the protobuf Transaction
//! message at a semantic level while remaining crate-local, so lance-table does
//! not depend on higher layers (e.g., lance crate).
//!
//! Conversion to protobuf occurs at the write boundary. See the `From<Transaction>`
//! implementation below.
