//! Batched f16 dot product with an optional AMX-FP16 tile backend.
//!
//! Used by IVF over an fp16 column under dot distance: [`dot_f16_batch_16`]
//! scores one query against 16 centroids when choosing the partitions to probe,
//! and the GEMM behind [`PackedCentroidsF16`] assigns vectors to partitions
//! while an index is built.
//!
//! [`dot_f16_batch_16`] returns the 16 raw dot products `Σ query·candidate`
//! (same value convention as [`crate::distance::dot()`]); the caller applies the
//! `1.0 - dot` distance wrapping. On Linux/x86_64 hosts with AMX-FP16 it
//! dispatches to a single tile pass; everywhere else (and on any AMX
//! unavailability) it falls back to 16 independent [`crate::distance::dot()`]
//! calls, which are bit-identical to the per-vector scalar path.
//!
//! Two gates cover all of this, and they are deliberately separate:
//! [`amx_fp16_supported`] answers whether the tile instructions can run here at
//! all, and [`amx_fp16_available`] adds the `LANCE_DISABLE_AMX` kill switch on
//! top. The kernels here are guarded by the former so tests can always reach
//! them; callers routing production work consult the latter. AMX is on by
//! default — the switch exists for A/B measurement and for getting the previous
//! path back without a rebuild.
//!
//! Unlike integer AMX kernels this is floating point: the AMX and fallback paths
//! are **not** bit-for-bit identical (tile accumulation order rounds
//! differently), but both accumulate products in f32 and agree to within fp16
//! precision — a relative error on the order of 1e-4, far below fp16's own
//! representational error, so recall is unaffected.
