//! Poor-man's SIMD
//!
//! The difference between this implementation and [std::simd] is that
//! this implementation holds the SIMD register directly, thus it exposes more
//! optimization opportunity to use wide range of instructions available.
//!
//! Also, it gives us more control, for example, it is likely that we will have
//! f16/bf16 support before the standard library does.
//!
//! The API are close to [std::simd] to make migration easier in the future.
