# Format Versioning

## Feature Flags

As the table format evolves, new feature flags are added to the format.
There are two separate fields for checking for feature flags,
depending on whether you are trying to read or write the table.
Readers should check the `reader_feature_flags` to see if there are any flag it is not aware of.
Writers should check `writer_feature_flags`. If either sees a flag they don't know,
they should return an "unsupported" error on any read or write operation.

## Current Feature Flags

<style>
.feature-flags-table th:nth-child(2),
.feature-flags-table td:nth-child(2) {
  white-space: nowrap;
  min-width: 250px;
}
</style>

<div class="feature-flags-table" markdown="1">

| Flag Bit | Flag Name                       | Reader Required | Writer Required | Description                                                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | `FLAG_DELETION_FILES`           | Yes             | Yes             | Fragments may contain deletion files, which record the tombstones of soft-deleted rows.                     |
| 2        | `FLAG_STABLE_ROW_IDS`           | Yes             | Yes             | Row IDs are stable for both moves and updates. Fragments contain an index mapping row IDs to row addresses. |
| 4        | `FLAG_USE_V2_FORMAT_DEPRECATED` | No              | No              | Files are written with the new v2 format. This flag is deprecated and no longer used.                       |
| 8        | `FLAG_TABLE_CONFIG`             | No              | Yes             | Table config is present in the manifest.                                                                    |
| 16       | `FLAG_BASE_PATHS`               | Yes             | Yes             | Dataset uses multiple base paths (for shallow clones or multi-base datasets).                               |
| 32       | `FLAG_DISABLE_TRANSACTION_FILE` | No              | Yes             | Transaction files are omitted when the manifest carries the transaction inline.                            |

</div>

Flags with bit values 64 and above are unknown and will cause implementations to reject the dataset with an "unsupported" error.

## Storage Version 2.3 Row Identity

Storage version 2.3 does not add a feature flag. Stable logical row addresses
are part of the storage-version contract and are mandatory for every 2.3
dataset, including an empty dataset. `FLAG_STABLE_ROW_IDS` continues to identify
only the optional legacy representation in storage version 2.2 and earlier.

Storage version is fixed for a dataset history. A 2.2 or earlier dataset cannot
enter 2.3 through overwrite, restore, or a manifest-only rewrite; 2.3 is used
only when creating a new dataset.
