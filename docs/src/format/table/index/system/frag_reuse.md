# Fragment Reuse Index

The Fragment Reuse Index is an internal index used to optimize fragment operations 
during compaction and dataset updates.

When data modifications happen against a Lance table,
it could trigger compaction and index optimization at the same time to improve data layout and index coverage.
By default, compaction will remap all indices at the same time to prevent read regression.
This means both compaction and index optimization could modify the same index and cause one process to fail.
Typically, the compaction would fail because it has to modify all indices and takes longer,
resulting in table layout degrading over time.

Fragment Reuse Index allows a compaction to defer the index remap process.
Suppose a compaction removes fragments A and B and produces C.
At query runtime, it reuses the old fragments A and B by 
updating the row addresses related to A and B in the index to the latest ones in C.
Because indices are typically cached in memory after initial load,
the in-memory index is up to date after the fragment reuse application process.

## Index Details

## Expected Use Pattern

Fragment Reuse Index should be created if the user defers index remap in compaction.
The index accumulates a new **reuse version** every time a compaction is executed.

As long as all the scalar and vector indices are created after the specific reuse version,
the indices are all caught up and the specific reuse version can be trimmed.

## Impacts

### Conflict Resolution

The presence of the Fragment Reuse Index changes how Lance detects conflicts between concurrent
operations. Operations that would normally conflict with compaction (such as index building) can
proceed without conflict when the FRI is in use. For full details on how conflict detection is
affected, see [conflict resolution](../../transaction.md#conflict-resolution).

### Index Load Cost

When the FRI is present, indices must be remapped at load time. Each time an index is loaded into
the cache, the FRI is applied to translate old row addresses to current ones. This adds a small
cost to index loading but does not affect query performance once the index is cached.

### FRI Growth and Cleanup

The FRI grows with each compaction. Every compaction that defers index remapping adds a new reuse
version to the index. Over time, this can accumulate and increase the cost of index loading since
more address translations must be applied.

Once all scalar and vector indices have been rebuilt past a given reuse version, that version is no
longer needed and can be trimmed. Users should schedule a periodic process to trim stale reuse
versions and keep the FRI size under control.
