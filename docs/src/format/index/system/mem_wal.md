# MemWAL Index

The MemWAL Index is a system index that serves as the centralized structure for all MemWAL metadata.
It stores configuration (shard specs, indexes to maintain), merge progress, and shard state snapshots.

A table has at most one MemWAL index.
The table may be a primary-key table or an append-only table without primary-key metadata.
Primary-key-dependent lookup and deduplication semantics only apply when a primary key is defined.
