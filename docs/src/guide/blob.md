# Blob Columns

Lance can store large binary objects (images, videos, audio, model artifacts) in blob columns, where they are treated like any other column payload in the dataset.
Blob columns support both planned full-payload reads and lazy file-like access.

!!! tip "Choosing between `read_blobs` and `take_blobs`"
    - For data loaders and batch processing that need complete byte payloads, use `read_blobs`.
    - Use `take_blobs` when you need a `BlobFile` handle for streaming, seeking, or partial reads.

If you're unsure about whether you need a blob column in the first place (and why it's useful), read the "[when to use blob column vs. inline binary](#when-to-use-a-blob-column-vs-inline-binary)" section below.

## Quick Start: Blob v2

This page focuses on blob workflows in Python and uses Lance file format terminology.

- `data_storage_version` means the Lance **file format version** of a dataset.
- A dataset's `data_storage_version` is fixed once the dataset is created.
- If you need a different file format version, write a **new dataset**.

```python
import lance
import pyarrow as pa
from lance import blob_array, blob_field

schema = pa.schema([
    pa.field("id", pa.int64()),
    blob_field("blob"),
])

table = pa.table(
    {
        "id": [1],
        "blob": blob_array([b"hello blob v2"]),
    },
    schema=schema,
)

ds = lance.write_dataset(table, "./blobs_v22.lance", data_storage_version="2.2")

_row_address, payload = ds.read_blobs("blob", indices=[0])[0]
assert payload == b"hello blob v2"
```

## Version Compatibility

Blob support is tied to the dataset's file format version. Earlier file format versions
(`< 2.2`) stored blobs using the `lance-encoding:blob` metadata field, while Blob
v2 introduces a new storage layout that requires file format `>= 2.2`.

The two
schemes are mutually exclusive: for file format `>= 2.2`, legacy blob metadata
(`lance-encoding:blob`) is rejected on write. The table below is the single
source of truth for which scheme is supported at each `data_storage_version`.

| Dataset `data_storage_version` | Legacy blob metadata (`lance-encoding:blob`) | Blob v2 (`lance.blob.v2`) |
|---|---|---|
| `0.1`, `2.0`, `2.1` | Supported for write/read | Not supported |
| `2.2+` | Not supported for write | Supported for write/read (recommended) |

## Blob v2: Write Patterns

Use `blob_field` and `blob_array` to build blob v2 columns.

```python
import lance
import pyarrow as pa
from lance import Blob, blob_array, blob_field

schema = pa.schema([
    pa.field("id", pa.int64()),
    blob_field("blob", nullable=True),
])

# A single column can mix:
# - inline bytes
# - external URI
# - external URI slice (position + size)
# - null
rows = pa.table(
    {
        "id": [1, 2, 3, 4],
        "blob": blob_array([
            b"inline-bytes",
            "s3://bucket/path/video.mp4",
            Blob.from_uri("s3://bucket/archive.tar", position=4096, size=8192),
            None,
        ]),
    },
    schema=schema,
)

ds = lance.write_dataset(
    rows,
    "./blobs_v22.lance",
    data_storage_version="2.2",
)
```

Note:

- By default, external blob URIs must map to a registered non-dataset-root base path.
- If you need to reference external objects outside those bases, set
  `allow_external_blob_outside_bases=True` when writing.
- Blob v2 storage layout thresholds can be configured per column with
  `blob_field(..., inline_size_threshold=..., dedicated_size_threshold=...)`.
  The inline threshold controls when values move from the data file to packed
  `.blob` sidecar storage. The dedicated threshold controls when values move
  from packed sidecar storage to a dedicated `.blob` file. The dedicated
  threshold is checked first. For existing columns, these thresholds are stored
  in the dataset schema; appends that explicitly provide different threshold
  metadata for the same column are rejected.
- `blob_pack_file_size_threshold` is a write option for rolling packed `.blob`
  sidecar files. It does not control inline-vs-packed placement.

### Example: packed external blobs (single container file)

```python
import io
import tarfile
from pathlib import Path
import lance
import pyarrow as pa
from lance import Blob, blob_array, blob_field

# Build a tar file with three payloads
payloads = {
    "a.bin": b"alpha",
    "b.bin": b"bravo",
    "c.bin": b"charlie",
}

with tarfile.open("container.tar", "w") as tf:
    for name, data in payloads.items():
        info = tarfile.TarInfo(name)
        info.size = len(data)
        tf.addfile(info, io.BytesIO(data))

# Capture offset/size for each member
blob_values = []
with tarfile.open("container.tar", "r") as tf:
    container_uri = Path("container.tar").resolve().as_uri()
    for name in payloads:
        m = tf.getmember(name)
        blob_values.append(Blob.from_uri(container_uri, position=m.offset_data, size=m.size))

schema = pa.schema([
    pa.field("name", pa.utf8()),
    blob_field("blob"),
])

rows = pa.table(
    {
        "name": list(payloads.keys()),
        "blob": blob_array(blob_values),
    },
    schema=schema,
)

ds = lance.write_dataset(
    rows,
    "./packed_blobs_v22.lance",
    data_storage_version="2.2",
    allow_external_blob_outside_bases=True,
)
```

## Blob v2: Read Patterns

Choose the read API based on the payload shape you want:

| API | Returns | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| `read_blobs` | `List[Tuple[int, bytes]]` | You need complete blob payloads in memory, such as training loaders or batch preprocessing. |
| `take_blobs` | `List[BlobFile]` | You need file-like objects for streaming, seeking, or partial reads. |
| `scanner(..., blob_handling="all_binary")` | Arrow binary columns | You want blob columns in a scan result or `pyarrow.Table`. |

Do not wrap `take_blobs` in your own thread pool just to call `read()` or
`readall()` on every blob. Use `read_blobs` instead; it plans and executes
batched blob reads through Lance's scheduler.

Exactly one selector must be provided to `read_blobs` or `take_blobs`: `ids`,
`indices`, or `addresses`.

| Selector | Typical Use | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `indices` | Positional reads within one dataset snapshot | Stable within that snapshot |
| `ids` | Logical row-id based reads | Stable logical identity (when row ids are available) |
| `addresses` | Low-level physical reads and debugging | Unstable physical location |

### Read complete payloads by row indices

```python
import lance

ds = lance.dataset("./blobs_v22.lance")
rows = ds.read_blobs("blob", indices=[0, 1])
payloads = [payload for _row_address, payload in rows]
```

### Read complete payloads by row ids

```python
import lance

ds = lance.dataset("./blobs_v22.lance")
row_ids = ds.to_table(columns=[], with_row_id=True).column("_rowid").to_pylist()

rows = ds.read_blobs("blob", ids=row_ids[:2])
```

### Read complete payloads by row addresses

```python
import lance

ds = lance.dataset("./blobs_v22.lance")
row_addrs = ds.to_table(columns=[], with_row_address=True).column("_rowaddr").to_pylist()

rows = ds.read_blobs("blob", addresses=row_addrs[:2])
```

### Read blob columns as Arrow binary

```python
import lance

ds = lance.dataset("./blobs_v22.lance")
table = ds.scanner(columns=["blob"], blob_handling="all_binary").to_table()
payloads = table.column("blob").to_pylist()
```

### Open file-like blob handles lazily

```python
import lance

ds = lance.dataset("./blobs_v22.lance")
blobs = ds.take_blobs("blob", indices=[0, 1])

with blobs[0] as f:
    header = f.read(1024)
```

### Example: decode video frames lazily

```python
import av
import lance

ds = lance.dataset("./videos_v22.lance")
blob = ds.take_blobs("video", indices=[0])[0]

start_ms, end_ms = 500, 1000

with av.open(blob) as container:
    stream = container.streams.video[0]
    stream.codec_context.skip_frame = "NONKEY"

    start = (start_ms / 1000) / stream.time_base
    end = (end_ms / 1000) / stream.time_base
    container.seek(int(start), stream=stream)

    for frame in container.decode(stream):
        if frame.time is not None and frame.time > end_ms / 1000:
            break
        # process frame
        pass
```

## Legacy Compatibility (`data_storage_version` <= `2.1`)

If you need to keep writing legacy blob columns, use file format `0.1`, `2.0`, or `2.1`
and mark `LargeBinary` fields with a metadata kwarg `"lance-encoding:blob": true`.

```python
import lance
import pyarrow as pa

schema = pa.schema([
    pa.field("id", pa.int64()),
    pa.field(
        "video",
        pa.large_binary(),
        metadata={"lance-encoding:blob": "true"},
    ),
])

table = pa.table(
    {
        "id": [1, 2],
        "video": [b"foo", b"bar"],
    },
    schema=schema,
)

ds = lance.write_dataset(
    table,
    "./legacy_blob_dataset",
    data_storage_version="2.1",
)
```

As mentioned above, this write pattern is invalid for `data_storage_version >= 2.2`.
For new datasets, it's recommended to use Lance file format 2.2, which uses blob v2 by default.

## Rewrite to a New Blob v2 Dataset

If your current dataset consists of legacy blobs (stored in file formats <2.2) and you want to opt in to blob v2, you must rewrite it as a new dataset with `data_storage_version="2.2"`.

```python
import lance
import pyarrow as pa
from lance import blob_array, blob_field

legacy = lance.dataset("./legacy_blob_dataset")
raw = legacy.scanner(columns=["id", "video"], blob_handling="all_binary").to_table()

new_schema = pa.schema([
    pa.field("id", pa.int64()),
    blob_field("video"),
])

rewritten = pa.table(
    {
        "id": raw.column("id"),
        "video": blob_array(raw.column("video").to_pylist()),
    },
    schema=new_schema,
)

lance.write_dataset(
    rewritten,
    "./blob_v22_dataset",
    data_storage_version="2.2",
)
```

!!! warning
    - The example above materializes binary payloads in memory (`blob_handling="all_binary"` and `to_pylist()`).
    - For large datasets, prefer chunked/batched rewrite pipelines.

## When to Use a Blob Column vs. Inline Binary

Not every binary column needs to be a blob column. Plain Arrow `binary`/`large_binary` stores bytes *inline*, interleaved with your other columns, which is simplest and fastest for really small blobs (e.g., thumbnail images). Using a blob column to store the binary payload makes sense when either of these holds:

- **You need partial or streaming reads.** Inline binary is always read in full; there is no way to fetch a byte range without materializing the entire value. Blob columns expose `take_blobs` → `BlobFile` handles that seek and range-read, so you pay only for the bytes you touch.
- **Your values are large (roughly 1 MB or more on average).** Operations that rewrite entire rows, such as compaction or some updates, must copy the large inline payloads forward into the new version — even when those bytes never changed. The bigger the payload, the more bytes you rewrite per logical change (write amplification). A blob column keeps large payloads in separate `.blob` files that are referenced rather than re-copied, so these operations don't rewrite the heavy bytes.

!!! tip
    As a rule of thumb, if average payload size is below a few tens of KB and you only ever read whole values, plain inline binary is fine. Above ~1 MB, or any time you want file-like access, prefer a blob column. Blob v2 also tunes this automatically: by default it keeps payloads under 16 KiB inline, packs mid-sized payloads into shared `.blob` sidecars, and gives payloads over 2 MiB their own dedicated `.blob` file.

## Troubleshooting

This section contains commonly noticed issues or errors, and explains how to address them.

### Blob v2 requires file version >= 2.2
**Cause**: You are writing blob v2 values into a dataset/file format below `2.2`.  
**Fix**: Write to a dataset created with `data_storage_version="2.2"` (or newer).

### Legacy blob columns ... are not supported for file version >= 2.2
**Cause**: You are using legacy blob metadata (`lance-encoding:blob`) while writing `2.2+` data.  
**Fix**: Replace legacy metadata-based columns with blob v2 columns (`blob_field` / `blob_array`).


### Exactly one of ids, indices, or addresses must be specified
**Cause**: `read_blobs` or `take_blobs` received none or multiple selectors.  
**Fix**: Provide exactly one of `ids`, `indices`, or `addresses`.
