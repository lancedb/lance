# Migration Guides

Lance aims to avoid breaking changes when possible.  Currently, we are refining the Rust public API so that we can move
it out of experimental status and make stronger commitments to backwards compatibility.  The python API is considered
stable and breaking changes should generally be communicated (via warnings) for 1-2 months prior to being finalized to
give users a chance to migrate.  This page documents the breaking changes between releases and gives advice on how to
migrate.

## 5.0.0

* The default data storage version changed from 2.0 to 2.1. This affects the `column_indices`
  field in the `DataFile` protobuf message. In 2.0, every field (including non-leaf fields like
  struct containers and list containers) was assigned a sequential column index. In 2.1, non-leaf
  fields (unpacked structs, list containers) are assigned `-1` instead since their validity
  information is now folded into repetition/definition levels. Only leaf fields and packed structs
  are assigned column indices.

    For example, given the schema:

    ```
    x: i32, y: [f32], z: { a: i32 }
    ```

    The fields (in depth-first order) are:

    | Field ID | Field         |
    |----------|---------------|
    | 0        | `x` (i32)     |
    | 1        | `y` (list)    |
    | 2        | `y.item` (f32)|
    | 3        | `z` (struct)  |
    | 4        | `z.a` (i32)   |

    In **2.0**, `column_indices` = `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` — every field gets a column.

    In **2.1**, `column_indices` = `[0, -1, 1, -1, 2]` — non-leaf fields (`y` and `z`) get `-1`.

* This change only affects advanced users who construct `DataFile` messages directly, for example
  when building operations by hand for `Dataset.commit`. Normal read and write paths are
  unaffected.

* To opt back to 2.0 format, set `data_storage_version="2.0"` when creating a dataset.

## 1.0.0

* The `SearchResult` returned by scalar indices must now output information about null values.
  Instead of containing a `RowIdTreeMap`, it now contains a `NullableRowIdSet`. Expressions that
  resolve to null values must be included in search results in the null set. This ensures that
  `NOT` can be applied to index search results correctly.

## 0.39

* The `lance` crate no longer re-exports utilities from `lance-arrow` such as `RecordBatchExt` or `SchemaExt`.  In the
short term, if you are relying on these utilities,  you can add a dependency on the `lance-arrow` crate.  However, we
do not expect `lance-arrow` to ever be stable, and you may want to consider forking these utilities.

* Previously, we exported `Error` and `Result` as both `lance::Error` and `lance::error::Error`.  We have now reduced
this to just `lance::Error`.  We have also removed some internal error utilities (such as `OptionExt`) from the public
API and do not plan on reintroducing these.

* The Python and Rust `dataset::diff_meta` API has been removed in favor of `dataset::delta`, 
which returns a `DatasetDelta` that offers both metadata diff through `list_transactions` and data diff 
through `get_inserted_rows` and `get_updated_rows`.

* Some other minor utilities which had previously been public are now private.  It is unlikely anyone was utilizing'
these.  Please open an issue if you were relying on any of these.

* The `lance-namespace` Rust crate now splits into `lance-namespace` that contains the main `LanceNamespace` trait 
and data models, and `lance-namespace-impls` that has different implementations of the namespace. 
The `DirectoryNamespace` and `RestNamespace` interfaces have been refactored to be more user friendly.
The `DirectoryNamespace` also now uses Lance ObjectStore for IO instead of directly depending on Apache OpenDAL.
