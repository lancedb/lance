Lance: modern columnar data format for ML
======================================================================================


Lance is a columnar data format that is easy and fast to version, query and train on. Itâ€™s designed to be used with images, videos, 3D point clouds, audio and of course tabular data. The key features of Lance include:

* **High-performance random access:** 100x faster than Parquet.

* **Vector search:** find nearest neighbors in under 1 millisecond and combine OLAP-queries with vector search.

* **Zero-copy, automatic versioning:** manage versions of your data automatically, and reduce redundancy with zero-copy logic built-in.

* **Ecosystem integrations:** Apache-Arrow, DuckDB and more on the way.
