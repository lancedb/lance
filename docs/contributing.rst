Guide for New Contributors
==========================

This is a guide for new contributors to the Lance project.
Even if you have no previous experience with python, rust, and open source, you can still make an non-trivial
impact by helping us improve documentation, examples, and more.
For experienced developers, the issues you can work on run the gamut from warm-ups to serious challenges in python and rust.

If you have any questions, please join our `Discord <https://discord.gg/zMM32dvNtd>`_ for real-time support. Your feedback is always welcome!

Getting Started
---------------

1. Join our Discord and say hi
2. Setup your development environment
3. Pick an issue to work on. See https://github.com/lancedb/lance/contribute for good first issues.
4. Have fun!

Development Environment
-----------------------

Currently Lance is implemented in Rust and comes with a Python wrapper. So you'll want to make sure you setup both.

1. Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Install Python 3.9+: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Install protoctol buffers: https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/ (make sure you have version 3.20 or higher)
4. Install commit hooks:
    a. Install pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/#install
    b. Run `pre-commit install` in the root of the repo

Sample Workflow
---------------
1. Fork the repo
2. Pick `Github issue <https://github.com/lancedb/lance/issues>`_
3. Create a branch for the issue
4. Make your changes
5. Create a pull request from your fork to lancedb/lance
6. Get feedback and iterate
7. Merge!
8. Go back to step 2

Python Development
------------------

See: https://github.com/lancedb/lance/blob/main/python/DEVELOPMENT.md

Rust Development
----------------

To format and lint Rust code:

.. code-block::

    cargo fmt --all
    cargo clippy --all-features --tests --benches

Repo Structure
--------------

Core Format
~~~~~~~~~~~
The core format is implemented in Rust under the `rust` directory. Once you've setup Rust you can build the core format with:

.. code-block::

    cargo build


This builds the debug build. For the optimized release build:

.. code-block::

    cargo build -r

To run the Rust unit tests:


.. code-block::

    cargo test


If you're working on a performance related feature, benchmarks can be run via:

.. code-block::

    cargo bench

Python Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Python bindings for Lance uses a mix of Rust (pyo3) and Python.
The Rust code that directly supports the Python bindings are under `python/src` while the pure Python code lives under `python/python`.

To build the Python bindings, first install requirements:

.. code-block::

    pip install maturin

To make a dev install:

.. code-block::

    maturin develop

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation is built using Sphinx and lives under `docs`.
To build the docs, first install requirements:

.. code-block::

    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

Then build the docs:

.. code-block::

    cd docs
    make html

The docs will be built under `docs/build/html`.

Example Notebooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example notebooks are under `examples`. These are standalone notebooks you should be able to download and run.

DuckDB Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In python, Lance integrates with DuckDB via Apache Arrow. Outside of python, the highly experimental duckdb extension for Lance
lives under `integration/duckdb_lance`. This uses the DuckDB `Rust extension framework <https://github.com/Mause/duckdb-extension-framework>`_.
The main code lives under `integration/duckdb_lance/src`. Follow the integration README for more details.

Benchmarks
~~~~~~~~~~

Our Rust benchmarks are run multiple times a day and the history can be found `here <https://github.com/lancedb/lance-benchmark-results>`_.

Separately, we have vector index benchmarks that test against the sift1m dataset, as well as benchmarks for tpch.
These live under `benchmarks`.
