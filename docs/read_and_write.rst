Read and Write Lance Dataset
============================

Lance dataset APIs follows the `PyArrow API <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html>`_
conventions.

Writing Lance Dataset
---------------------

Similar to Apache Pyarrow, the simplest approach to create a Lance dataset is
writing a :py:class:`pyarrow.Table` via :py:meth:`lance.write_dataset`.

  .. code-block:: python

    import lance
    import pyarrow as pa

    table = pa.Table.from_pylist([{"name": "Alice", "age": 20},
                                  {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}])
    lance.write_dataset(table, "./alice_and_bob.lance")

If the memory footprint of the dataset is too large to fit in memory, :py:meth:`lance.write_dataset`
also supports writing a dataset in iterator of :py:class:`pyarrow.RecordBatch` es.

  .. code-block:: python

    import lance
    import pyarrow as pa

    def producer():
        yield pa.RecordBatch.from_pylist([{"name": "Alice", "age": 20}])
        yield pa.RecordBatch.from_pylist([{"name": "Blob", "age": 30}])

    lance.write_dataset(producer, "./alice_and_bob.lance")

:py:meth:`lance.write_dataset` supports writing :py:class:`pyarrow.Table`, :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame`,
:py:class:`pyarrow.Dataset`, and ``Iterator[pyarrow.RecordBatch]``. Check its doc for more details.

Reading Lance Dataset
---------------------

To open a Lance dataset, use the :py:meth:`lance.dataset` function:

  .. code-block:: python

    import lance
    ds = lance.dataset("s3://bucket/path/imagenet.lance")
    # Or local path
    ds = lance.dataset("./imagenet.lance")

  .. note::

    Lance supports local file system, AWS ``s3`` and Google Cloud Storage(``gs``) as storage backends
    at the moment. See :ref:`storages` for more details.

The most straightforward approach for reading a Lance dataset is to utilize the :py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.to_table`
method in order to load the entire dataset into memory.

  .. code-block:: python

    table = ds.to_table()

Due to Lance being a high-performance columnar format, it enables efficient reading of subsets of the dataset by utilizing
**Column (projection)** push-down and **filter (predicates)** push-downs.

    .. code-block:: python

        table = ds.to_table(
            columns=["image", "label"],
            filter="label = 2 AND text IS NOT NULL",
            limit=1000,
            offset=3000)

Lance understands the cost of reading heavy columns such as ``image``.
Consequently, it employs an optimized query plan to execute the operation efficiently.

Iterative Read
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the dataset is too large to fit in memory, you can read it in batches
using the :py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.to_batches` method:

  .. code-block:: python

    for batch in ds.to_batches(columns=["image"], filter="label = 10"):
        # do something with batch
        compute_on_batch(batch)

Unsurprisingly, :py:meth:`~lance.LanceDataset.to_batches` takes the same parameters
as :py:meth:`~lance.LanceDataset.to_table` function.

Filter push-down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lance embraces the utilization of standard SQL expressions as predicates for dataset filtering.
By pushing down the SQL predicates directly to the storage system,
the overall I/O load during a scan is significantly reduced.

Currently, Lance supports a growing list of expressions.

* ``>``, ``>=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``=``
* ``AND``, ``OR``, ``NOT``
* ``IS NULL``, ``IS NOT NULL``
* ``IS TRUE``, ``IS NOT TRUE``, ``IS FALSE``, ``IS NOT FALSE``
* ``IN``
* ``LIKE``, ``NOT LIKE``
* ``regexp_match(column, pattern)``

For example, the following filter string is acceptable:

  .. code-block:: SQL

    ((label IN [10, 20]) AND (note.email IS NOT NULL))
        OR NOT note.created

If your column name contains special characters or is a `SQL Keyword <https://docs.rs/sqlparser/latest/sqlparser/keywords/index.html>`_,
you can use backtick (`````) to escape it. For nested fields, each segment of the
path must be wrapped in backticks. 

  .. code-block:: SQL

    `CUBE` = 10 AND `column name with space` IS NOT NULL
      AND `nested with space`.`inner with space` < 2

.. warning::

  Field names containing periods (``.``) are not supported.

Random read
~~~~~~~~~~~

One district feature of Lance, as columnar format, is that it allows you to read random samples quickly.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Access the 2nd, 101th and 501th rows
        data = ds.take([1, 100, 500], columns=["image", "label"])

The ability to achieve fast random access to individual rows plays a crucial role in facilitating various workflows
such as random sampling and shuffling in ML training.
Additionally, it empowers users to construct secondary indices,
enabling swift execution of queries for enhanced performance.
