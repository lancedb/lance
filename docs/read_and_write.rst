Read and Write Lance Dataset
============================

Lance dataset APIs follows the `PyArrow API <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html>`_
conventions.

Writing Lance Dataset
---------------------

Similar to Apache Pyarrow, the simplest approach to create a Lance dataset is
writing a :py:class:`pyarrow.Table` via :py:meth:`lance.write_dataset`.

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  import pyarrow as pa

  table = pa.Table.from_pylist([{"name": "Alice", "age": 20},
                                {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}])
  lance.write_dataset(table, "./alice_and_bob.lance")

If the memory footprint of the dataset is too large to fit in memory, :py:meth:`lance.write_dataset`
also supports writing a dataset in iterator of :py:class:`pyarrow.RecordBatch` es.

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  import pyarrow as pa

  def producer():
      yield pa.RecordBatch.from_pylist([{"name": "Alice", "age": 20}])
      yield pa.RecordBatch.from_pylist([{"name": "Blob", "age": 30}])

  schema = pa.schema([
          pa.field("name", pa.string()),
          pa.field("age", pa.int64()),
      ])

    lance.write_dataset(reader, "./alice_and_bob.lance", schema)

:py:meth:`lance.write_dataset` supports writing :py:class:`pyarrow.Table`, :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame`,
:py:class:`pyarrow.Dataset`, and ``Iterator[pyarrow.RecordBatch]``. Check its doc for more details.

Deleting rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lance supports deleting rows from a dataset using a SQL filter. For example, to
delete Bob's row from the dataset above, one could use:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance

  dataset = lance.dataset("./alice_and_bob.lance")
  dataset.delete("name = 'Bob'")

:py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.delete` supports the same filters as described in
:ref:`filter-push-down`.

Rows are deleted by marking them as deleted in a separate deletion index. This is
faster than rewriting the files and also avoids invaliding any indices that point
to those files. Any subsequent queries will not return the deleted rows.

.. warning::
  
  Do not read datasets with deleted rows using Lance versions prior to 0.5.0,
  as they will return the deleted rows. This is fixed in 0.5.0 and later.

Updating rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lance supports updating rows based on SQL expressions with the
:py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.update` method. For example, if we notice
that Bob's name in our dataset has been sometimes written as ``Blob``, we can fix
that with:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance

  dataset = lance.dataset("./alice_and_bob.lance")
  dataset.update({"name": "'Bob'"}), where="name = 'Blob'")

The update values are SQL expressions, which is why ``'Bob'`` is wrapped in single
quotes. This means we can use complex expressions that reference existing columns if
we wish. For example, if two years have passed and we wish to update the ages
of Alice and Bob in the same example, we could write:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance

  dataset = lance.dataset("./alice_and_bob.lance")
  dataset.update({"age": "age + 2"})

If you are trying to update a set of individual rows with new values then it is often
more efficient to use the merge insert operation described below.

.. code-block:: python

  import lance

  # Change the ages of both Alice and Bob
  new_table = pa.Table.from_pylist([{"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
                                    {"name": "Bob", "age": 20}])

  # This works, but is inefficient, see below for a better approach
  dataset = lance.dataset("./alice_and_bob.lance")
  for idx in range(new_table.num_rows):
    name = new_table[0][idx].as_py()
    new_age = new_table[1][idx].as_py()
    dataset.update({"age": new_age}, where=f"name='{name}'")

Merge Insert
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lance supports a merge insert operation.  This can be used to add new data in bulk
while also (potentially) matching against existing data.  This operation can be used
for a number of different use cases.

Bulk Update
^^^^^^^^^^^

The :py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.update` method is useful for updating rows based on
a filter.  However, if we want to replace existing rows with new rows then a merge
insert operation would be more efficient:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance

  # Change the ages of both Alice and Bob
  new_table = pa.Table.from_pylist([{"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
                                    {"name": "Bob", "age": 20}])
  dataset = lance.dataset("./alice_and_bob.lance")
  # This will use `name` as the key for matching rows.  Merge insert
  # uses a JOIN internally and so you typically want this column to
  # be a unique key or id of some kind.
  dataset.merge_insert("name") \
         .when_matched_update_all() \
         .execute(new_table)

Note that, similar to the update operation, rows that are modified will
be removed and inserted back into the table, changing their position to
the end.  Also, the relative order of these rows could change because we
are using a hash-join operation internally.

Insert if not Exists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes we only want to insert data if we haven't already inserted it
before.  This can happen, for example, when we have a batch of data but
we don't know which rows we've added previously and we don't want to
create duplicate rows.  We can use the merge insert operation to achieve
this:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance

  # Bob is already in the table, but Carla is new
  new_table = pa.Table.from_pylist([{"name": "Bob", "age": 30},
                                    {"name": "Carla", "age": 37}])

  dataset = lance.dataset("./alice_and_bob.lance")

  # This will insert Carla but leave Bob unchanged
  dataset.merge_insert("name") \
         .when_not_matched_insert_all() \
         .execute(new_table)

Update or Insert (Upsert)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes we want to combine both of the above behaviors.  If a row
already exists we want to update it.  If the row does not exist we want
to add it.  This operation is sometimes called "upsert".  We can use
the merge insert operation to do this as well:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance

  # Change Carla's age and insert David
  new_table = pa.Table.from_pylist([{"name": "Carla", "age": 27},
                                    {"name": "David", "age": 42}])

  dataset = lance.dataset("./alice_and_bob.lance")

  # This will update Carla and insert David
  dataset.merge_insert("name") \
         .when_matched_update_all() \
         .when_not_matched_insert_all() \
         .execute(new_table)

Replace a Portion of Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A less common, but still useful, behavior can be to replace some region
of existing rows (defined by a filter) with new data.  This is similar
to performing both a delete and an insert in a single transaction.  For
example:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance

  new_table = pa.Table.from_pylist([{"name": "Edgar", "age": 46},
                                    {"name": "Francene", "age": 44}])

  dataset = lance.dataset("./alice_and_bob.lance")

  # This will remove anyone above 40 and insert our new data
  dataset.merge_insert("name") \
         .when_not_matched_insert_all() \
         .when_not_matched_by_source_delete("age >= 40") \
         .execute(new_table)


Evolving the schema
-------------------

Lance supports schema evolution: adding, removing, and altering columns in a
dataset. Most of these operations can be performed *without* rewriting the
data files in the dataset, making them very efficient operations.

In general, schema changes will conflict with most other concurrent write 
operations. For example, if you change the schema of the dataset while someone
else is appending data to it, either your schema change or the append will fail,
depending on the order of the operations. Thus, it's recommended to perform
schema changes when no other writes are happening.

Renaming columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Columns can be renamed using the :py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.alter_columns`
method.

.. testcode::

    import lance
    import pyarrow as pa
    table = pa.table({"id": pa.array([1, 2, 3])})
    dataset = lance.write_dataset(table, "ids")
    dataset.alter_columns({"path": "id", "name": "new_id"})
    dataset.to_table().to_pandas()

.. testoutput::

       new_id
    0       1
    1       2
    2       3

This works for nested columns as well. To address a nested column, use a dot
(``.``) to separate the levels of nesting. For example:

.. testcode::

    data = [
      {"meta": {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}},
      {"meta": {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}},
    ]
    dataset = lance.write_dataset(data, "nested_rename")
    dataset.alter_columns({"path": "meta.id", "name": "new_id"})

.. testoutput::

        meta
      0  {"new_id": 1, "name": "Alice"}
      1  {"new_id": 2, "name": "Bob"}


Casting column data types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to changing column names, you can also change the data type of a
column using the :py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.alter_columns` method. This
requires rewriting that column to new data files, but does not require rewriting
the other columns.

.. note::

  If the column has an index, the index will be dropped if the column type is
  changed.

This method can be used to change the vector type of a column. For example, we
can change a float32 embedding column into a float16 column to save disk space
at the cost of lower precision:

.. testcode::

    import lance
    import pyarrow as pa
    import numpy as np
    table = pa.table({
       "id": pa.array([1, 2, 3]),
       "embedding": pa.FixedShapeTensorArray.from_numpy_ndarray(
           np.random.rand(3, 128).astype("float32"))
    })
    dataset = lance.write_dataset(table, "embeddings")
    dataset.alter_columns({"path": "embedding",
                           "type": pa.list_(pa.float16(), 128)})
    dataset.schema()

.. testoutput::

    id: int64
    embedding: fixed_size_list<item: float16, 128>


Adding new columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New columns can be added and populated within a single operation using the
:py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.add_columns` method. There are two ways to specify
how to populate the new columns: first, by providing a SQL expression for each
new column, or second, by providing a function to generate the new column data.

SQL expressions can either be independent expressions or reference existing
columns. SQL literal values can be used to set a single value for all 
existing rows.

.. testcode::

    import lance
    import pyarrow as pa
    table = pa.table({"name": pa.array(["Alice", "Bob", "Carla"])})
    dataset = lance.write_dataset(table, "names")
    dataset.add_columns({
        "hash": "sha256(name)",
        "status": "'active'",
    })
    dataset.to_table().to_pandas()
  
.. testoutput::

        name         hash...   status
    0  Alice  3bc51062973c...  active
    1    Bob  cd9fb1e148cc...  active
    2  Carla  ad8d83ffd82b...  active

You can also provide a Python function to generate the new column data. This can
be used, for example, to compute a new embedding column. This function should
take a PyArrow RecordBatch and return either a PyArrow RecordBatch or a Pandas
DataFrame. The function will be called once for each batch in the dataset.

If the function is expensive to compute and can fail, it is recommended to set
a checkpoint file in the UDF. This checkpoint file saves the state of the UDF
after each invocation, so that if the UDF fails, it can be restarted from the
last checkpoint. Note that this file can get quite large, since it needs to store
unsaved results for up to an entire data file.

.. code-block::

    import lance
    import pyarrow as pa
    import numpy as np

    table = pa.table({"id": pa.array([1, 2, 3])})
    dataset = lance.write_dataset(table, "ids")

    @lance.batch_udf(checkpoint_file="embedding_checkpoint.sqlite")
    def add_random_vector(batch):
        embeddings = np.random.rand(batch.num_rows, 128).astype("float32")
        return pd.DataFrame({"embedding": embeddings})
    dataset.add_columns(add_random_vector)


Adding new columns using merge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have pre-computed one or more new columns, you can add them to an existing
dataset using the :py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.merge` method. This allows filling in
additional columns without having to rewrite the whole dataset.


To use the ``merge`` method, provide a new dataset that includes the columns you
want to add, and a column name to use for joining the new data to the existing
dataset.

For example, imagine we have a dataset of embeddings and ids:

.. testcode::

    import lance
    import pyarrow as pa
    import numpy as np
    table = pa.table({
       "id": pa.array([1, 2, 3]),
       "embedding": pa.array([np.array([1, 2, 3]), np.array([4, 5, 6]),
                              np.array([7, 8, 9])])
    })
    dataset = lance.write_dataset(table, "embeddings")

Now if we want to add a column of labels we have generated, we can do so by merging a new table:

.. testcode::

    new_data = pa.table({
       "id": pa.array([1, 2, 3]),
       "label": pa.array(["horse", "rabbit", "cat"])
    })
    dataset.merge(new_data, "id")
    dataset.to_table().to_pandas()

.. testoutput::

       id  embedding   label
    0   1  [1, 2, 3]   horse
    1   2  [4, 5, 6]  rabbit
    2   3  [7, 8, 9]     cat


Dropping columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, you can drop columns from a dataset using the :py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.drop_columns`
method. This is a metadata-only operation and does not delete the data on disk. This makes
it very quick.

.. testcode::

    import lance
    import pyarrow as pa
    table = pa.table({"id": pa.array([1, 2, 3]),
                      "name": pa.array(["Alice", "Bob", "Carla"])})
    dataset = lance.write_dataset(table, "names")
    dataset.drop_columns(["name"])
    dataset.schema()
  
.. testoutput::

    id: int64

To actually remove the data from disk, the files must be rewritten to remove the
columns and then the old files must be deleted. This can be done using 
:py:meth:`lance.dataset.DatasetOptimizer.compact_files()` followed by
:py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.cleanup_old_versions()`.


Reading Lance Dataset
---------------------

To open a Lance dataset, use the :py:meth:`lance.dataset` function:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  ds = lance.dataset("s3://bucket/path/imagenet.lance")
  # Or local path
  ds = lance.dataset("./imagenet.lance")

.. note::

  Lance supports local file system, AWS ``s3`` and Google Cloud Storage(``gs``) as storage backends
  at the moment. Read more in `Object Store Configuration`_.

The most straightforward approach for reading a Lance dataset is to utilize the :py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.to_table`
method in order to load the entire dataset into memory.

.. code-block:: python

  table = ds.to_table()

Due to Lance being a high-performance columnar format, it enables efficient reading of subsets of the dataset by utilizing
**Column (projection)** push-down and **filter (predicates)** push-downs.

.. code-block:: python

    table = ds.to_table(
        columns=["image", "label"],
        filter="label = 2 AND text IS NOT NULL",
        limit=1000,
        offset=3000)

Lance understands the cost of reading heavy columns such as ``image``.
Consequently, it employs an optimized query plan to execute the operation efficiently.

Iterative Read
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the dataset is too large to fit in memory, you can read it in batches
using the :py:meth:`lance.LanceDataset.to_batches` method:

.. code-block:: python

  for batch in ds.to_batches(columns=["image"], filter="label = 10"):
      # do something with batch
      compute_on_batch(batch)

Unsurprisingly, :py:meth:`~lance.LanceDataset.to_batches` takes the same parameters
as :py:meth:`~lance.LanceDataset.to_table` function.


.. _filter-push-down:

Filter push-down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lance embraces the utilization of standard SQL expressions as predicates for dataset filtering.
By pushing down the SQL predicates directly to the storage system,
the overall I/O load during a scan is significantly reduced.

Currently, Lance supports a growing list of expressions.

* ``>``, ``>=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``=``
* ``AND``, ``OR``, ``NOT``
* ``IS NULL``, ``IS NOT NULL``
* ``IS TRUE``, ``IS NOT TRUE``, ``IS FALSE``, ``IS NOT FALSE``
* ``IN``
* ``LIKE``, ``NOT LIKE``
* ``regexp_match(column, pattern)``
* ``CAST``

For example, the following filter string is acceptable:

.. code-block:: SQL

  ((label IN [10, 20]) AND (note.email IS NOT NULL))
      OR NOT note.created

If your column name contains special characters or is a `SQL Keyword <https://docs.rs/sqlparser/latest/sqlparser/keywords/index.html>`_,
you can use backtick (`````) to escape it. For nested fields, each segment of the
path must be wrapped in backticks. 

.. code-block:: SQL

  `CUBE` = 10 AND `column name with space` IS NOT NULL
    AND `nested with space`.`inner with space` < 2

.. warning::

  Field names containing periods (``.``) are not supported.

Literals for dates, timestamps, and decimals can be written by writing the string
value after the type name. For example

.. code-block:: SQL

  date_col = date '2021-01-01'
  and timestamp_col = timestamp '2021-01-01 00:00:00'
  and decimal_col = decimal(8,3) '1.000'

For timestamp columns, the precision can be specified as a number in the type
parameter. Microsecond precision (6) is the default.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 30 40
    :header-rows: 1

    * - SQL
      - Time unit
    * - ``timestamp(0)``
      - Seconds
    * - ``timestamp(3)``
      - Milliseconds
    * - ``timestamp(6)``
      - Microseconds
    * - ``timestamp(9)``
      - Nanoseconds

Lance internally stores data in Arrow format. The mapping from SQL types to Arrow
is:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 30 40
    :header-rows: 1

    * - SQL type
      - Arrow type
    * - ``boolean``
      - ``Boolean``
    * - ``tinyint`` / ``tinyint unsigned``
      - ``Int8`` / ``UInt8``
    * - ``smallint`` / ``smallint unsigned``
      - ``Int16`` / ``UInt16``
    * - ``int`` or ``integer`` / ``int unsigned`` or ``integer unsigned``
      - ``Int32`` / ``UInt32``
    * - ``bigint`` / ``bigint unsigned``
      - ``Int64`` / ``UInt64``
    * - ``float``
      - ``Float32``
    * - ``double``
      - ``Float64``
    * - ``decimal(precision, scale)``
      - ``Decimal128``
    * - ``date``
      - ``Date32``
    * - ``timestamp``
      - ``Timestamp`` (1)
    * - ``string``
      - ``Utf8``
    * - ``binary``
      - ``Binary``

(1) See precision mapping in previous table.


Random read
~~~~~~~~~~~

One district feature of Lance, as columnar format, is that it allows you to read random samples quickly.

.. code-block:: python

    # Access the 2nd, 101th and 501th rows
    data = ds.take([1, 100, 500], columns=["image", "label"])

The ability to achieve fast random access to individual rows plays a crucial role in facilitating various workflows
such as random sampling and shuffling in ML training.
Additionally, it empowers users to construct secondary indices,
enabling swift execution of queries for enhanced performance.


Table Maintenance
-----------------

Some operations over time will cause a Lance dataset to have a poor layout. For
example, many small appends will lead to a large number of small fragments. Or
deleting many rows will lead to slower queries due to the need to filter out
deleted rows.

To address this, Lance provides methods for optimizing dataset layout.

Compact data files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data files can be rewritten so there are fewer files. When passing a
``target_rows_per_fragment`` to :py:meth:`lance.dataset.DatasetOptimizer.compact_files`,
Lance will skip any fragments that are already above that row count, and rewrite
others. Fragments will be merged according to their fragment ids, so the inherent
ordering of the data will be preserved.

.. note::

  Compaction creates a new version of the table. It does not delete the old 
  version of the table and the files referenced by it.

.. code-block:: python

    import lance

    dataset = lance.dataset("./alice_and_bob.lance")
    dataset.optimize.compact_files(target_rows_per_fragment=1024 * 1024)

During compaction, Lance can also remove deleted rows. Rewritten fragments will
not have deletion files. This can improve scan performance since the soft deleted
rows don't have to be skipped during the scan.

When files are rewritten, the original row addresses are invalidated. This means the
affected files are no longer part of any ANN index if they were before. Because
of this, it's recommended to rewrite files before re-building indices.

.. TODO: remove this last comment once move-stable row ids are default.

Object Store Configuration
--------------------------

Lance supports object stores such as AWS S3 (and compatible stores), Azure Blob Store,
and Google Cloud Storage. Which object store to use is determined by the URI scheme of
the dataset path. For example, ``s3://bucket/path`` will use S3, ``az://bucket/path``
will use Azure, and ``gs://bucket/path`` will use GCS.

.. versionadded:: 0.10.7

  Passing options directly to storage options.

These object stores take additional configuration objects. There are two ways to
specify these configurations: by setting environment variables or by passing them
to the ``storage_options`` parameter of :py:meth:`lance.dataset` and
:py:func:`lance.write_dataset`. So for example, to globally set a higher timeout,
you would run in your shell:

.. code-block:: bash

  export TIMEOUT=60s

If you only want to set the timeout for a single dataset, you can pass it as a
storage option:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  ds = lance.dataset("s3://path", storage_options={"timeout": "60s"})


General Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options apply to all object stores.

.. from https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/enum.ClientConfigKey.html

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Description
   * - ``allow_http``
     - Allow non-TLS, i.e. non-HTTPS connections. Default, ``False``.
   * - ``download_retry_count``
     - Number of times to retry a download. Default, ``3``.  This limit is applied when
       the HTTP request succeeds but the response is not fully downloaded, typically due
       to a violation of ``request_timeout``.
   * - ``allow_invalid_certificates``
     - Skip certificate validation on https connections. Default, ``False``.
       Warning: This is insecure and should only be used for testing.
   * - ``connect_timeout``
     - Timeout for only the connect phase of a Client. Default, ``5s``.
   * - ``request_timeout``
     - Timeout for the entire request, from connection until the response body
       has finished. Default, ``30s``.
   * - ``user_agent``
     - User agent string to use in requests.
   * - ``proxy_url``
     - URL of a proxy server to use for requests. Default, ``None``.
   * - ``proxy_ca_certificate``
     - PEM-formatted CA certificate for proxy connections
   * - ``proxy_excludes``
     - List of hosts that bypass proxy. This is a comma separated list of domains
       and IP masks. Any subdomain of the provided domain will be bypassed. For 
       example, ``example.com, 192.168.1.0/24`` would bypass ``https://api.example.com``,
       ``https://www.example.com``, and any IP in the range ``192.168.1.0/24``.


S3 Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

S3 (and S3-compatible stores) have additional configuration options that configure
authorization and S3-specific features (such as server-side encryption).

AWS credentials can be set in the environment variables ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``,
``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``, and ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN``. Alternatively, they can be
passed as parameters to the ``storage_options`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  ds = lance.dataset(
      "s3://bucket/path",
      storage_options={
          "access_key_id": "my-access-key",
          "secret_access_key": "my-secret-key",
          "session_token": "my-session-token",
      }
  )

If you are using AWS SSO, you can specify the ``AWS_PROFILE`` environment variable.
It cannot be specified in the ``storage_options`` parameter.

The following keys can be used as both environment variables or keys in the
``storage_options`` parameter:

     - Whether to use bucket keys for server-side encryption.


S3-compatible stores
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lance can also connect to S3-compatible stores, such as MinIO. To do so, you must
specify both region and endpoint:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  ds = lance.dataset(
      "s3://bucket/path",
      storage_options={
          "region": "us-east-1",
          "endpoint": "http://minio:9000",
      }
  )

This can also be done with the ``AWS_ENDPOINT`` and ``AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`` environment variables.

S3 Express
^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 0.9.7

Lance supports `S3 Express One Zone`_ endpoints, but requires additional configuration. Also,
S3 Express endpoints only support connecting from an EC2 instance within the same
region.

.. _S3 Express One Zone: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/express-one-zone/

To configure Lance to use an S3 Express endpoint, you must set the storage option
``s3_express``. The bucket name in your table URI should **include the suffix**.

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  ds = lance.dataset(
      "s3://my-bucket--use1-az4--x-s3/path/imagenet.lance",
      storage_options={
          "region": "us-east-1",
          "s3_express": "true",
      }
  )


Committing mechanisms for S3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most supported storage systems (e.g. local file system, Google Cloud Storage,
Azure Blob Store) natively support atomic commits, which prevent concurrent
writers from corrupting the dataset. However, S3 does not support this natively.
To work around this, you may provide a locking mechanism that Lance can use to
lock the table while providing a write. To do so, you should implement a
context manager that acquires and releases a lock and then pass that to the
``commit_lock`` parameter of :py:meth:`lance.write_dataset`.

.. note::

  In order for the locking mechanism to work, all writers must use the same exact
  mechanism. Otherwise, Lance will not be able to detect conflicts.

On entering, the context manager should acquire the lock on the table. The table
version being committed is passed in as an argument, which may be used if the
locking service wishes to keep track of the current version of the table, but
this is not required. If the table is already locked by another transaction,
it should wait until it is unlocked, since the other transaction may fail. Once
unlocked, it should either lock the table or, if the lock keeps track of the
current version of the table, return a :class:`CommitConflictError` if the
requested version has already been committed.

To prevent poisoned locks, it's recommended to set a timeout on the locks. That
way, if a process crashes while holding the lock, the lock will be released
eventually. The timeout should be no less than 30 seconds.

.. code-block:: python

  from contextlib import contextmanager

  @contextmanager
  def commit_lock(version: int);
      # Acquire the lock
      my_lock.acquire()
      try:
        yield
      except:
        failed = True
      finally:
        my_lock.release()
  
  lance.write_dataset(data, "s3://bucket/path/", commit_lock=commit_lock)

When the context manager is exited, it will raise an exception if the commit
failed. This might be because of a network error or if the version has already
been written. Either way, the context manager should release the lock. Use a 
try/finally block to ensure that the lock is released.

Concurrent Writer on S3 using DynamoDB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

  This feature is experimental at the moment

Lance has native support for concurrent writers on S3 using DynamoDB instead of locking.
User may pass in a DynamoDB table name alone with the S3 URI to their dataset to enable this feature.

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  # s3+ddb:// URL scheme let's lance know that you want to
  # use DynamoDB for writing to S3 concurrently
  ds = lance.dataset("s3+ddb://my-bucket/mydataset?ddbTableName=mytable")

The DynamoDB table is expected to have a primary hash key of ``base_uri`` and a range key ``version``.
The key ``base_uri`` should be string type, and the key ``version`` should be number type.

For details on how this feature works, please see :ref:`external-manifest-store`.


Google Cloud Storage Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GCS credentials are configured by setting the ``GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`` environment
variable to the path of a JSON file containing the service account credentials.
Alternatively, you can pass the path to the JSON file in the ``storage_options``

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  ds = lance.dataset(
      "gs://my-bucket/my-dataset",
      storage_options={
          "service_account": "path/to/service-account.json",
      }
  )

.. note::
  
  By default, GCS uses HTTP/1 for communication, as opposed to HTTP/2. This improves
  maximum throughput significantly. However, if you wish to use HTTP/2 for some reason,
  you can set the environment variable ``HTTP1_ONLY`` to ``false``.


The following keys can be used as both environment variables or keys in the
``storage_options`` parameter:

.. source: https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/gcp/enum.GoogleConfigKey.html

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Description
   * - ``google_service_account`` / ``service_account``
     - Path to the service account JSON file.
   * - ``google_service_account_key`` / ``service_account_key``
     - The serialized service account key.
   * - ``google_application_credentials`` / ``application_credentials``
     - Path to the application credentials.


Azure Blob Storage Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Azure Blob Storage credentials can be configured by setting the ``AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME``
and ``AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`` environment variables. Alternatively, you can pass
the account name and key in the ``storage_options`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

  import lance
  ds = lance.dataset(
      "az://my-container/my-dataset",
      storage_options={
          "account_name": "some-account",
          "account_key": "some-key",
      }
  )

These keys can be used as both environment variables or keys in the ``storage_options`` parameter:

.. source: https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/azure/enum.AzureConfigKey.html

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key

     - Bearer token.
   * - ``azure_storage_use_emulator`` / ``object_store_use_emulator`` / ``use_emulator``
     - Use object store with azurite storage emulator.
   * - ``azure_endpoint`` / ``endpoint``
     - Override the endpoint used to communicate with blob storage.
   * - ``azure_use_fabric_endpoint`` / ``use_fabric_endpoint``
     - Use object store with url scheme account.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com.
   * - ``azure_msi_endpoint`` / ``azure_identity_endpoint`` / ``identity_endpoint`` / ``msi_endpoint``
     - Endpoint to request a imds managed identity token.
