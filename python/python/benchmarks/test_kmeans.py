# This test is very large, but needs to be to make the CPU vs GPU comparison
# meaningful. GPU can be faster, but the overhead of copying data to and from
# the GPU can be significant. Only once the problem size is large enough does
# the benefit of GPU computation outweigh the overhead of copying data. Therefore,
# these tests are marked as slow, and are opt-in.
