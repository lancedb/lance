"""Smoke test for the runtime object-store scheme registration hook.

Exercises the pyo3 additions in ``python/src/object_store.rs`` and the new
``store_registry=`` parameter on ``Session(...)``. Registers the built-in
``MemoryStoreProvider`` under a made-up scheme (``test-mem``) and proves that
``lance.write_dataset(...)`` and ``lance.dataset(...)`` route reads and writes
through the registry-selected store rather than the default built-in scheme
resolver.

The full Python-to-Rust ``ObjectStoreProvider`` callable bridge is not exercised
here — that is a follow-up. See the module docstring in
``python/src/object_store.rs``.
